        <h2>Spotify Cookie Policy</h2>
        <h5>Effective as of 29 May 2023</h5>

        <h3>1. What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website.
            Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support
            the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions.
            You can find more general information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

        <h3>2. How do we use cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your
            preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see
            online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

        <h3>3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads</h3>
        <p>You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the
            instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).

            Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of
            the Spotify website. To find out more information, you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

        <h3>4. Updates to this Policy</h3>
        <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

            When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under
            the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Services or send you an
            email or device notification.</p>
